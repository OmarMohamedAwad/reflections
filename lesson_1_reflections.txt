What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros :
    - i save the importent change . 
    - if i want what i maked last time it is easily .
    - if i want remove some change it is easy.
    - if i modfie some thing it ease to know what is 

    cons :
    - if we not use correctly it make recovary and search diffecult.
    - some time may be forget to save changes.

    becuse some change in file effect in anther file.
